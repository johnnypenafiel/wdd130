        ¿What is PPS? <br>
        <br>PPS (Peñafiel Professional Services) is a website run by his only one owner, Johnny Peñafiel Mera. An economist, graduated from Universidad Técnica de Machala, in 2020. He has gotten some prizes because of being an outstanding student.

        Below, we explain in detail the services that you can acquire on this website: <br>
        <br>1.	Market research <br>
        <br>Before or during the development of a company, regardless of its size, the market must be studied in depth. This will allow you to know what type of service or good would be more convenient to market within certain sectors. In addition, you will become capable of knowing who your direct and indirect competitors are, analyzing your advantages or disadvantages with respect to them and also establishing strategies to be more efficient and gain more space within the market.
        So, if you want to start a company or if you already have one, we will take care of researching the market at an opportune time and space. Some of the services included in this service are:
        - Conducting consumer surveys, in order to establish what product or good they need to satisfy their needs.
        - Tabulation, processing and analysis of data, through the SPSS tool.
        - Creation of the SWOT, to establish strategies that allow you to achieve your organizational objectives.
        - Investment advice and acquisition of bank loans to start your business, expand it or add value to the existing one.<br>
        <br> 2. English Teaching <br>
        <br>Did you know how important it is to know a language other than your native one?
        According to the British Council (2020), 25% of job offers require the applicant to speak English, at least at an intermediate level. About 375 million people in the world speak technical English applied to business. In addition, knowing English will allow you to open the doors to study in hundreds of universities worldwide.
        At PPS you will learn English skills, according to your need and according to your time availability.
        Which is the first step? Take a diagnostic test to find out your language proficiency in the 4 main areas: reading, writing, speaking and listening.
        Once the results are obtained, you can start the 100% personalized classes, at the basic or intermediate level.
        Best of all, you can take your classes in person or virtually, at a time that fits your daily responsibilities.
        An additional service that we offer is completely free pedagogical assistance to solve tasks related to English, either in schools or colleges.<br>
        <br>3.  Website Design <br>
        <br>Currently, owning a website can offer you comparative advantages in the market against the competition. Because technology grows more and more every day, consumers seek their comfort and find the necessary information from companies with a couple of clicks on the Internet.
        In addition, a web page is the perfect place to sell your image as a company and let people know what products or services you have, as well as prices, locations, opening hours and additional services, such as the page that you are visiting right now.
        If you want to innovate technologically and give your organization a plus, we are here to help you. Our service is frontend, that is, we design everything that you want the end user to be able to see on their computer or smartphone, with the colors, images, and styles that you want. In addition, you will have your own domain with the name of your company, which becomes a formality and generates trust in customers.
