                <p class="p9">Main Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho</p>
                <p class="rivers-paragraph1"> Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of  No Return winds the Salmon river. 
                    The Salmon was given the nickname long ago as the River of No Return by the people
                    living near it because of the number of folks that came to visit and fell so in love
                    with the rugged beauty of the river that they never left.<br>
                    <br>
                    Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river and bear and bighorn 
                    sheep are also commonly sighted. The river corridor is also lined with awe inspiring
                    ponderosa pine which tower over the sandy beaches in the campsites and provide shelter. <br>
                    <br>
                    Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon is one of the 
                    longest undammed rivers in the United States. As a free flowing river the water is higher, 
                    faster, and colder in the early summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late summer. 
                    There are good rapids all summer...but families with children who like to swim tend to 
                    appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer water more.</p>

                <p class="rivers-paragraph2" >
                    Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most<br> desolate land anywhere, the Green
                    river flows towards the mighty Colorado river and the sea.<br> <br>High grey stone cliffs, beautiful 
                    desert scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous. This 84-mile trip runs from from 
                    Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green River Utah) and boasts outstanding scenery, 
                    interesting geologic formations, evidence of prehistoric and historic human activity, and great
                    whitewater opportunities.<br>
                    <br>
                    Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually done in 6 days.
                    <br>
                    Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark.  <br>This designation is based on the 
                    uniqueness and rich history that the canyon tells.</p>

                <p class="p11"> Grand Canyon, Arizona</p>
                <p class="rivers-paragraph3"> 
                    This is the grand daddy of all canyons and the grand daddy of all river trips. You will never 
                    forget your visit to the Grand Canyon.<br>
                    <br>
                    Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with breathtaking scenery to make one
                    truly unforgettable river experience. The canyon is filled not only with exhilarating whitewater
                    rapids, but with side canyons and ancient indian ruins accessible only by river.<br>
                    <br>
                    CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. The rapids in the Canyon are 
                    technically rated I - X ( 1 - 10) to accommodate such a wide variety of rapids and river variances.
                    However, most people are familiar with the regular I - V river rating scale, so we often refer to 
                    both.</p>
