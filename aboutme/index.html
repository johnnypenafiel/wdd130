    <h2>John</h2>
    <p>Hello, my name is Johnny. I'm 27 seven years old. I'm from Guayaquil, Ecuador.
    I'm married since April 21st (2023), with my wonderful and beautiful wife, Ivonne.
    I'm a member of the Church of Jesus Christ since May 20th, 2017 and I served my mission in my country</p>
    <p> Currently I work at a high school, I'm a teacher and I have worked in this field 
        around 4 years.</p>
    <p> In my free time, I really love to spend time with my family and also I like play 
        the ukulele and sing (just for myself). I don't like to dance, but I always do it
        because of my wife, she really makes me do crazy things</p>
    <p> I decided to study this career because I really love technology, I think throught this, 
        we could help others by developing useful skills. For me BYU is amazing because I can 
        learn in the way of my Heavenly Father and I feel my brother JesusChrist closer to me 
        everyday. </p>
